# Home Page

The **Home Page** component is the primary view of the stock market application. It displays stock data in a table format, as well as additional sections for showing the biggest gainers and losers in the market. This page integrates with the backend to fetch real-time stock data, handle loading states, and display any error messages when necessary.

### Features:

- **Stock Data Table**: Displays essential stock information such as symbol, market price, previous close, and market change.
- **Biggest Gainers and Losers Tables**: Two separate tables that highlight the top gainers and losers from the stock market.
- **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during data fetching, the component will display an appropriate error message to the user.
- **Refetching Mechanism**: Users can refresh the stock data using a refetch button.
