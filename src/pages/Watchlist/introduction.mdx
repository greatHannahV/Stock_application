## Stories

### Default Watchlist

This story shows the basic behavior of the `Watchlist` component without any customization. It represents the default view where the user can see a list of stocks they are watching.

```ts
const Template: StoryFn = () => <Watchlist />;
export const Default = Template.bind({});
```
