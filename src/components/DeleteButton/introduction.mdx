# DeleteButton Component

The **DeleteButton** component is a simple button used to trigger the deletion of a stock from a user's watchlist or portfolio. It allows users to remove a stock by clicking on the button, providing immediate feedback by calling an action on the click event. This component is particularly useful when managing stock data in an interactive application.

### Features:

- **Stock Removal**: The button triggers the removal of a stock when clicked.
- **Action Feedback**: When the button is clicked, it fires an event that can be captured to trigger further actions, like removing the stock from the UI.
- **Customizable Props**: You can pass in a stock object to customize the buttonâ€™s context, such as showing the stock's name or symbol.
