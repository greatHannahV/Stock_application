# ButtonsController Component

The **ButtonsController** component allows users to select a chart type from a list of available options. This component is useful for switching between different chart visualizations (e.g., candle, bar, line, etc.), giving users flexibility in how they view the data.

### Features:

- **Chart Type Selection**: Users can choose from various chart types, including `candle`, `bar`, `line`, `area`, and more.
- **Interactive UI**: The component allows the user to interactively select the chart type, with the selected option being highlighted.
- **Customizable Chart Types**: The chart types can be easily extended or modified by passing a new list of options.

## Stories

### Default View

  },
};
```
