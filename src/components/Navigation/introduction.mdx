# Navigation Component

The `Navigation` component is a key part of the application's user interface, responsible for rendering the navigation menu. It integrates with context and routing mechanisms, provided by the `withProviders` decorator.

## Setup and Requirements

The `Navigation` component relies on a higher-order decorator, `withProviders`, which encapsulates the necessary providers. This ensures that the component has access to context, routing, and any other global configurations.

### Decorator: `withProviders`

The `withProviders` decorator abstracts the following:

- **React Router**: Provides routing capabilities using `BrowserRouter`.
- **React Query**: Supplies server-state management with `QueryClientProvider`.
- **App Context**: Shares application-level state via the `AppProvider`.

The decorator eliminates the need for boilerplate code and simplifies testing and development of components.

### Usage in Storybook

In Storybook, the `Navigation` component is wrapped with the `withProviders` decorator to ensure all necessary contexts are available:
