# Search Component

The `Search` component provides a flexible and user-friendly search interface. It is designed to integrate seamlessly into your application and supports dynamic states such as loading.

## Setup and Requirements

The `Search` component is wrapped with the `withProviders` decorator, ensuring that all necessary contexts and configurations are applied for consistent functionality.

### Decorator: `withProviders`

The `withProviders` decorator sets up essential providers, including:

- **React Context**: Provides global state management where necessary.
- **Custom Providers**: Any additional dependencies or global configurations required by the component.

## Usage in Storybook

The `Search` component's stories demonstrate two primary states: `Default` and `WithLoading`. These states showcase the flexibility and responsiveness of the component.
