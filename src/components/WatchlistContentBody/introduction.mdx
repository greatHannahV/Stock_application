# WatchlistContentBody Component

The `WatchlistContentBody` component displays a list of bookmarked stocks in a table format. Each row represents a stock with details like its name, symbol, and market information. The component also includes a `DeleteButton` for removing the stock from the list.

## Usage

This component expects two props:

- `bookedStocks`: An array of stocks to be displayed.
- `removeBookmark`: A function to handle removing a bookmark when the delete button is clicked.

In this story, we demonstrate how the `WatchlistContentBody` component renders a list of stocks and allows users to remove them by clicking the delete button. The action of clicking the delete button is captured and logged in the Storybook actions panel.
