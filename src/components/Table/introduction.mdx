# Table Component

The `Table` component is a flexible and dynamic table designed for displaying stock data. It supports scenarios such as showing the table in a loading state or with stock data. You can easily customize it with mock data or real-time stock data.

## Setup and Requirements

The `Table` component utilizes the `withProviders` decorator to ensure proper context setup and configuration in your application. This ensures that global state management and any necessary providers are applied consistently.

### Decorator: `withProviders`

The `withProviders` decorator is used to set up:

- **Global Context**: Ensures all necessary contexts, including global state, are available.
- **Custom Dependencies**: Configures other essential dependencies needed by the component.

## Usage in Storybook

This Storybook implementation showcases two primary use cases for the `Table` component:

### Stories Overview

#### Default

The `Default` story demonstrates the `Table` component with mock stock data and without a loading state.

export const Default = Template.bind({});
Default.args = {
  isLoading: false,
  stocks: mockStocks,
};
```
