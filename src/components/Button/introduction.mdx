# Button Component

The **Button** component is a customizable UI element that can be used to trigger actions such as data fetching or submitting forms. It is highly flexible and can be tailored to display different states, such as a loading state while fetching data.

### Features:

- **Action Triggering**: The button triggers an action, such as a data refetch, when clicked.
- **Loading State**: The component has a built-in loading state, which can be toggled using the `isFetching` prop.
- **Customizable Props**: The button's appearance and behavior can be customized using props like `refetch` and `isFetching`.
