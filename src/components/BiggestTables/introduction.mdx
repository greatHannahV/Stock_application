# BiggestTables Component

The **BiggestTables** component is designed to showcase two key tables in the stock market application: the biggest gainers and biggest losers. It displays a list of stocks sorted by market performance, helping users quickly identify the top-performing and worst-performing stocks. The component handles both the loading state and displays the stocks dynamically.

### Features:

- **Biggest Gainers and Losers**: Displays two separate tables for the biggest gainers and losers, showing real-time market performance.
- **Loading State**: A loading indicator is displayed while the data is being fetched or processed.
- **Dynamic Data**: The component accepts stock data as props and renders the respective tables accordingly.
