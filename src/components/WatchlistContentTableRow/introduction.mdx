# WatchlistContentTableRow Component

The `WatchlistContentTableRow` component is used to render a row in the watchlist table. It displays key stock information for individual items in the watchlist, such as the stock name, price, change, and other relevant metrics. This component is designed to be part of a larger table structure where users can quickly view and compare their tracked stocks.

## Purpose

The `WatchlistContentTableRow` component is essential for displaying data about a single stock in the context of a watchlist. It ensures that each row of stock data is displayed consistently with the necessary details, making it easy for users to monitor their investments at a glance.

## Setup and Requirements

This component requires a `stock` prop, which is an object containing the details of a specific stock. The `stock` prop should be passed as an object with key information such as:

- `shortName`
- `symbol`
- `regularMarketPrice`
- `regularMarketChange`
- `regularMarketChangePercent`
- `regularMarketTime`
- `currency`
- `exchangeName`
